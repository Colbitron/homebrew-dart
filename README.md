# Dart for Homebrew

This is the official [Dart][] tap for [homebrew][].

Mac users can use these formulae to easily install and update Dart SDK and
Dartium. Both dev and stable channels are supported.

## Initial setup

If you don't have homebrew, install it from their [homepage][homebrew].

Then, add this tap:

```
brew tap dart-lang/dart
```

## Installing

To install the Dart SDK:

```
brew install dartsdk
```

For web developers, we highly recommend Dartium:

```
brew install dartium
```

## Updating

Simply run:

```
brew upgrade dartsdk
brew upgrade dartium
```
